/**
 * The customers. Each brings a real car (an engine from the preset catalogue), a real
 * problem the simulator genuinely produces, and a request. None of them names a table:
 * they describe what the car does, the way customers do, and finding the cause is the
 * job.
 *
 * The six scenarios the old career had are all here, turned into customers: the
 * injector swap, the stale VE after a cam, the untuned turbo, the intake, the full
 * session and the power-with-reliability build. `tests/career.test.js` holds every one
 * to two facts on the real simulator: it fails as delivered, and a real fix passes it.
 *
 * Criteria (see evaluate.js):
 *   events   none of these pull-log entries on the handed-back car
 *   mixture  at full throttle, actual AFR within `pct` of what the table asks
 *   minHp    peak wheel power, as a number or as a share of a reference car's
 *   maxEgt   exhaust temperature ceiling, °C
 *   maxDuty  injector duty ceiling, %
 *   untouched  a table the customer asked you not to bend, within `tol`
 *   idle     holds idle: running, swing and offset from target in RPM
 *   score    Tuning Score at least `min`
 * `kind` sorts them: the complaint is what they came in for, safety is what keeps the
 * engine alive, and request is anything else they asked for.
