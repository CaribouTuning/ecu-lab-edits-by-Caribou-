      'The best point is MBT, minimum advance for best torque. Past it you gain nothing but knock risk. More boost, heat or compression lowers the knock limit, and the ECU’s knock control will pull timing back out, costing power.',

      'Idle problems are drivability problems. Customers notice them at every red light, and a car that stalls in traffic is not safe to hand back.',
