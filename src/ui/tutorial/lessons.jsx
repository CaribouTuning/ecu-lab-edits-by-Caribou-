/**
 * The tutorial's content: five chapters of short lessons, each teaching one thing.

 * RPM" is whatever the player's own first pull will say, today and after the physics
 * next changes. Every screen shown is the real screen (see ScreenSnippet.jsx).
 *
 * The lesson shape follows what tutorial writers keep arriving at: say what the reader
 * will be able to do and what they need, show the real thing, work one example through
 * with real numbers, have them do it in the game, tell them what they did, and cover
 * what usually goes wrong. Background that is useful but not needed goes in an Aside.
