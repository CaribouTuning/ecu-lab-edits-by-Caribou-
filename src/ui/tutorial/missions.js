/**
 * Practice missions: the Tuning Course's lessons, done for real in the player's own game.
 *
 * A mission is a short checklist. Each step is a question about the game's state (has
 * a pull been run since the last step? is the intake fitted? is AIRFLOW open?), so the
 * checklist ticks itself as the player works, the way a good in-product tour does:
 * nobody presses "I did it". Steps complete in order, and when one does, the game's
 * state at that moment is kept as its mark, so a later step can ask "since then".
 *
 * Pure: every check reads a context and returns a boolean.
