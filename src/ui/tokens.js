/**
 * The palette, and the single place it is defined.
 *
 * `tokens.css` mirrors this file as CSS custom properties for stylesheets, and
 * `tests/tokens.test.js` proves the two never drift. Add a colour here first.
 *
 * The organising rule: THE ACCENT IS NEVER A STATUS, AND A STATUS IS NEVER
 * DECORATION. `acc` means "this is the action" or "this is the live value".
 * `ok`/`warn`/`danger` mean engine state and nothing else. The previous palette
 * spent its alarm colour on chrome — 84 uses of the same hot orange on the
 * wordmark, the nav, the focus ring and genuine warnings alike — which left a real
 * warning nothing to escalate to.
