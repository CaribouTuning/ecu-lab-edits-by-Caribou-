/**
 * The pull, addressed by RPM.
 *
 * DATALOG used to render one card per entry in `RPM` from `src/sim/tables.js` — the VE
 * TABLE's axis, borrowed because the constant was in scope. A default pull produces 61
 * sweep points and that axis has eight entries, one of which sits below the sweep's
 * start, so 54 points were in memory and unreachable. These three functions are what
 * make them addressable.
 *
 * Pure and DOM-free, same as `eventBands.js`: a decision buried in JSX is a decision no
 * test can reach.
